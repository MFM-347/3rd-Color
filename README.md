3rd Color is a powerful, user-friendly color tool app that offers color information, seamless color conversion, and advanced color modification features. Explore and transform colors easily.

## Future Plans

- I may add color scheme generation like **[uicolors.app](https://uicolors.app/)** and **[chromax.app](https://www.chromax.app/)**.
- I may (`or may not`) rename **3rd Color** to **ColorXpret**.
